# POS systems (Point of Sale)

    Every store has a specific POS vendor from the following list

        1.) SICOM
        2.) NCR
        3.) CARROLS 

    *Note Popeyes only has 1 and 2, while BK has all 1,2, and 3

# Environments

    There are 4 environments for which code is written and tested...
        1.) dev (development) - mostly used by developers
        2.) staging - where lots of your regression testing will be done
        3.) qa 
        4.) prod (production)

# Testing on web apps

    EXAMPLE: To test the plk (popeyes) web app in the staging environment, 
             you would visit the following url: https://staging.web.plk.rbi.tools/ 
             When prompted for a password, enter {rbi} without the curly braces.
    
    If you wanted to test BK on qa, the relevant url would be the following:
    https://qa.web.bk.rbi.tools/

    *Note: The store and the environment are specified in the url 

# Using Jira

    Once you have access to Jira, most tests will be accessible through the 
    following url: https://rbictg.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=40&projectKey=CBA

    EXAMPLE: To clone a test cycle, 
        1.) clicks on Tests on the sidebar.
        2.) Click cycles on the top right
        3.) Pick a cycle to clone, e.g. plk staging etc
        4.) Click the checkbox and then click clone (should be a button above the list of tests)
        5.) Click clone on the modal that shows up
        6.) Change the name to edit out the clone bit, as well as the date

# Looking up Restaurant information on Sanity

    Sanity is a tool that RBI uses to keep track of store data such as 
    specific store items,corresponding PLU numbers, and their associated
    POS vendor.

    EXAMPLE: To use the sanity tool for the plk web app, you would switch the 
             <web> section of the url from before to <menu>, i.e.
             https://stagin.menu.plk.rbi.tools/


 # To sync POS data on AWS

     1.) go to link: https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/console/home?region=us-east-2#
     2.) go services then Lambda
     3.) make sure role account is: rbi-ctg-staging, and role is: rbi/admin
     4.) make sure location is US East (N. Virginia)
     5.) for BK filter keywords are: bk, menu, staging, all
     6.) have to create new test event for pos systemts NCR, SICOM, and Carrols
     e.g. {
             "posVendor": "SICOM"
          }
  
     7.) for PLK filter words are menu, staging, plk, some
     8.) create new test event with following form for NCR
         {
             "storeIds": [
             "999989"
             ]
         }
         for SICOM the store id is 88516

# Running RBI apps locally with yarn dev

    1.) Must first have been invited to rbilabs
    2.) Clone EngineeringMonoRepo to local machine
    3.) On your github account, 
        -Go to settings
        -Developer Settings
        -Personal access tokens
        -Generate new token
        -Check the {write:packages} option
        -generate token
    4.) Follow instructions at: https://github.com/rbilabs/ctg-devops/blob/master/examples/developer-configs/.npmrc

    *Note: Also checkout: https://github.com/rbilabs/EngineeringMonoRepo/blob/dev/README.md#web

# Using DataDog

    1. Go to datadog
    2. go to logs
    3. click search
    4. look up rbiorder id ---> This is gotten from going to dev tools under the network tab and looking for the graphQL query of the error
    5. take note of the time frame youre search in (top right of screen)
    6. Also take note of status (probably want to only include errors and warnings in filters)
    7. after you find the row of interest then search for trace id under service

# Using Cypress

    1.) relevant file path in repo: MonoRepo-> Cypress-> Integration->regression->plk->coupons
    2.) terminal command to start cypress. (have app running locally in one terminal window and other for cypress)
        REACT_APP_RBI_BRAND=bk REACT_APP_RBI_PLATFORM=web REACT_APP_RBI_ENV=test IS_E2E=true yarn serve-and-test test:e2e:cypress-local
    3.) here is the link to cypress dashboard. Ask samantha for access: https://dashboard.cypress.io/login
